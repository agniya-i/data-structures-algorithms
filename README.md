 ### DS + A  

This repo contains solutions for some problems I learned about while studying and preparing for job interviews. 
Each folder has problems solutions, my own implementation of data structure, and some notes related to the topic.

<i>It was a quick solution, just to store in one place some of the materials, each file can be run using `node [filename]`</i>
